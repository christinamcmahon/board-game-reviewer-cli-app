Flatiron - Mod 1 Project: My Board Games Reviewer
========================

My Board Games Reviewer was created by Christina ([christinamcmahon](https://github.com/christinamcmahon)). 

## About

My Board Games Reviewer allows users to get information about and rate Christina's selection of board games. The user can also find information like which of Christina's board games is most popular.

This CLI app uses a database to persist information about Christina's board games. This project demonstrates the following skills:
- Ruby
- Object Orientation
- Relationships (via ActiveRecord)
- Problem Solving (via creating a Command Line Interface (CLI))

This app makes use of the following gems:
- [tty-font](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-font)
- [tty-prompt](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-prompt)
- [colorize](https://github.com/fazibear/colorize)
- sinatra-activerecord
